         <h1>TEA PLANTATION IN SRILANKA</h1>
    
        <p>The majority of estates are found in Sri Lanka’s Southern Hill Country. While the region has countless charms – waterfall-covered mountains and jaw-dropping scenery where rattling railway stock clunks its way through old-world colonial towns and country piles seemingly copy-pasted from Middle England – it is the tea plantations that are the main draw of these highlands.</p>

        <p>Sitting in the shadow of the lush greenery of Pidurutalagala, 3km east of Nuwara Eliya, Pedro Tea Estate was established on the very spot that James Taylor planted his first tea bushes and kick-started the Ceylon tea industry. Established in 1885, the factory was under British ownership until it was nationalised in 1975, before being reprivatised just a decade later. Despite its plantations and tea fields being less picturesque than others, it is one of the most easily accessible estates in the hill country and the 20-minute long tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading to packaging, where you will see plenty of pieces of colonial-era equipment that is still in operation.<br><br>
            Overlooking the factory building is the picturesque Lovers Leap Ethical Tea Boutique where you can enjoy sipping on the local produce amongst a lush mountainous backdrop with a splendid view of the Bomburella Reservoir. Nearby, you will also find the Lover’s Leap Waterfall which plunges over a cliff face at the foot of Pidurutalagala and can be reached via a relatively serene 2km hike from the Pedro estate.</p>

        <p>The expansive Damro Labookelie Tea Estate, set in 5000 acres or gorgeous rolling hillside 20km north of Nuwara Eliya, is much more scenic than Pedro Tea Estate with the surrounding countryside feeling much more unblemished and unspoilt. The factory was originally part of the MAckwoods conglomerate, founded in 1841 and nowadays contains a rather modern and visitor centre complete with a café where you can sample the estate’s teas. Due to its easy to each location on the main road between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, the factory can become busy during the high season but the brief free tour gives a good overview of the production process.</p>

        <p>The factory can still be found between Haputale and Bandarawela, equidistant from both. While many of the tea factories around Sri Lanka have modernised, the slightly disheveled Dambatenne site still produces tea much the same as it did when it was first built in 1890, with the old machinery and process remaining unchanged for 130 years. Tours are available, however, there is no tea for sale on-site. If you want to see the whole factory in operation, it is best to arrive before noon.<br><br>Around 7km by curving hillside roads from the factory is Lipton’s seat, perched high above Dambatenne and named after the estate’s owner. It is one of the finest viewpoints in all of Sri Lanka, so much so that Sir Thomas Lipton often came up here to admire the scenery, often bringing business associates so he could wow them with the splendour of his plantation. It will take around 2 hours to hike up to the hill’s peak, although rather than trekking around wide hairpins, it’s possible to speed up the journey by taking shortcuts up stone steps that are hidden between the rows of tea bushes.<br><br>Gradually, as you get higher, the views become more expansive until you reach the highpoint at the statue of Thomas Lipton at the hill’s summit where the 360-degree vista of the surrounding countryside stretches all the way to the coast on a clear day. as mist and clouds can obstruct the view on most afternoons, I would recommend reaching the summit early morning. Even if you don’t fancy the uphill slog, you can reach the Seat by tuk-tuk for a few hundred rupees and enjoy a leisurely walk back to Dambatelle.</p>

        <p>Being one of the biggest factories in the hill country, Uva Halpewatte tea factory is the perfect staring point for people looking to get to grips with Sri Lankan tea production. Dating from 1940, Halpewatte runs one of the best and most informative tours on the island, taking you through the process from picking to the final product.<br><br>

            The factory is located just 5km north of Ella and most local tuk-tuk drivers will be able to take you there, although they can charge up to RS. 1000 for a return trip. Alternatively, the factory can be reached by taking two buses, first catching the bus towards Bandarawela and alighting at Kumbawela junction before hopping on an onward bus to Badulla. You will need to get off just after the 27km post at Halpe Temple and walk the rest of the way.<br><br>
            
            Tours take place every day except Mondays and the day after public holidays since there is no tea plucking on Sundays.</p>
