        <h1>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h1>
        <h2>The history of pure ceylon tea</h2>
        <p>The story of tea begins with the entrance of devastating hit to a thriving coffee plantations industry. A disease known as “coffee rust” brought a natural death to the coffee growing era of Sri Lanka. The first tea plant was brought to shore by the British in 1824 and was planted at Haggala Botanical Gardens.<br>It was James Taylor in 1867 who initiated this pioneering step by taking a bold step towards changing the path of a nation. A 19 acre estate called Loolecondra Estate situated in the hill capital of Kandy was the first commercial tea plantation of Ceylon.<br>The tea plant, known as Camellia Sinensis, for this project was specially brought from Assam by James Taylor himself. He was a young Scotsman who arrived on the shores of the island when he was only 19 years old in 1852.Having fallen in love with the island, he only ventured to India after his arrival and this was to learn all there is to know about tea. Self-educating himself in Assam he decided to introduce it to the land he was destined to change.</p>
